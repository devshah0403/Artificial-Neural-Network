# Artificial Neural Network
 Here, you will find the Python code. Using this Artificial Neural Network, the script classifies many medicines according to one given data set. The script explains end-to-end procedures about this, including preprocessing the dataset, creating models, and fitting.  Key elements include:  Load the drug dataset (drugdataset.csv). Splitting the data into training and test sets. Scaling the data to enhance the model's performance.
# Getting Started
Hereâ€™s how you can get the project up and running on your computer.
